# TAPL in Python

Python implementation of type checker examples in the book Types and 
Programming Languages. It is written for Python 3.7 and above, aiming to be as 
close as possible to the original OCaml version for reading purposes.

The book [Types and Programming Languages](
http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/main.html) is written by Benjamin C. 
Pierce. The [original examples](
http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/checkers/) written in OCaml are 
partially included in this repository for reference.

Unless specified individually, other Python code is written by 
[DecentFoX Studio](https://decentfox.com) and released under BSD license.
